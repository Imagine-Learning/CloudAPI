### Allowed HTTPs requests:

* POST   :   To create a resource, or to call specific non-resource actions

### Resource Format
The Imagine Learning REST API currently only supports JSON resource requests and representations.  Please let us know if you need another format.

## Responses

Each response from the Imagine Learning Cloud API contains:

| ITEM               | DESCRIPTION    
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP Status Code   | The code indicates general success or failure of the request - see details below
| HTTP Headers       | Various response headers are set relevant to the particular request.
| Response Body      | Successful requests contain the an entity resource representation, while failed requests show an error representation.

### HTTP Response Codes used

- 200 `OK` - the request was successful.  The Response body contains entity resource data.
- 201 `Created` - the request was successful and a resource was created.
- 204 `No Content` - the request was successful, but there is no content to return
- 304 `Not Modified` - the resource has not been modied and therefore not retured (used with request headers If-Modified-Since or If-Match).
- 400 `Bad Request` - the request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
- 401 `Unauthorized` - authentication failed (missing or invalid authentication token).
- 403 `Forbidden` - authentication failed (account does not access to a resource or operation).
- 404 `Not Found` - resource was not found.
- 500 `Internal Server Error` - an unexpected error or condition was encountered.
- 503 `Service Unavailable` - We are temporarily unable to service the request. Please wait for a bit and try again.

* `<resource name>` - this section is the resource that was requested
* `notifications` - this section contains notifications of changes that the client may want to reflect in the UI

# Group Authentication

This is an authenticated API which uses [Client Credentials Grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) flow of the [OAuth2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) specification as the authentication mechanism.

To use this API:

- An application makes a request to the POST /api/token endpoint to exchange credentials for a bearer token.
- When accessing the REST API, the application uses the bearer token to authenticate.


#Client Credentials Grant authorization
##Tokens are passwords
Keep in mind that the bearer token itself grants access to make requests on behalf of an application. These values should be considered as sensitive as passwords and must not be shared or distributed to untrusted parties.

##SSL absolutely required
To ensure student privacy and to fulfill legal obligations under [FERPA](http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/ferpa.index.htm), all requests (both to obtain and use tokens) must use HTTPS endpoints




##Step 1: Obtain a bearer token

Credentials must be exchanged for a bearer token by issuing a request to POST api/token:

- The request must be a `HTTP POST` request.
- The body of the request must be `grant_type=password&username=XXX&password=YYY`.

######Example request (Authorization header has been wrapped):

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: api.imaginelearning.com
User-Agent: Imagine Learning Unity Player
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 67

grant_type=password&username=demo@imaginelearning.com&password=demo
```

If the request was formatted correctly, the server will respond with a JSON-encoded payload:

######Example response (access_token has been wrapped):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 468
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Expires: -1
Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2014 19:53:41 GMT

{
  "access_token":"rDdBkKmtpFiYUoKlZF-LqH4qkyQM_ZywDHqF1IcViinRZg795x9aROHEwM2qlvqXPurtqRcb8GQXtx3npLUXg0ZNuBEf24HgMwNw2h6jqzbVAYc-BqukZvQ78_NaMkOzowAAzJxc9UhZ0BVWlYgNKzrMtpI_NVihRDdlygCV8GxSYL-NnVpjEOc8FxtN2m23JgOCcJIUSyUPs6WvP-buDdPO-oy9iFIMI4wk4eMdNqgRFoFLg-XFhB-S_dAqLi1Cr2_4PDgbkuHrOgUHdwXHsvolzTMC7NGTRQp0LYFLt3CZMxjBVOKEj8AxyVKR_4zO4oc4ta9dO0SKdEh4i-vEMw",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":1209599,
  "username":"demo@imaginelearning.com",
  "role":"Student",
  "displayname":"Demo User"
}
```

Applications should verify that the value associated with the `token_type` key of the returned object is `bearer`. The value associated with the access_token key is the bearer token.

Note that one bearer token is valid for an application at a time. Issuing another request with the same credentials to /token will return the same token until it is invalidated.

##Step 2: Authenticate API requests with the bearer token

The bearer token may be used to issue requests to the REST API endpoints. To use the bearer token, construct a normal HTTPS request and include an `Authorization` header with the value of 
`Bearer <base64 access_token value from step 1 response>` . Signing is not required.

######Example request:
```
GET <some api> HTTP/1.1
Host: api.imaginelearning.com
User-Agent: Imagine Learning Unity Player
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8
Authorization: bearer rDdBkKmtpFiYUoKlZF-LqH4qkyQM_ZywDHqF1IcViinRZg795x9aROHEwM2qlvqXPurtqRcb8GQXtx3npLUXg0ZNuBEf24HgMwNw2h6jqzbVAYc-BqukZvQ78_NaMkOzowAAzJxc9UhZ0BVWlYgNKzrMtpI_NVihRDdlygCV8GxSYL-NnVpjEOc8FxtN2m23JgOCcJIUSyUPs6WvP-buDdPO-oy9iFIMI4wk4eMdNqgRFoFLg-XFhB-S_dAqLi1Cr2_4PDgbkuHrOgUHdwXHsvolzTMC7NGTRQp0LYFLt3CZMxjBVOKEj8AxyVKR_4zO4oc4ta9dO0SKdEh4i-vEMw

# Group Sequencing

## Product [/products]

A product resource represents a sequenced product that can be played.

### Get products [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            [
                { "identifier": "ILE" },
                { "identifier": "Spanish" },
                { "identifier": "Test" },
                { "identifier": "CommunicationTest" }
            ]
        }

## Activity [/activities{?product,clientActivitySupport}]

An Activity resource represents the next activity selected for the Student to play

### Get next Activity [GET]

The selectedContent construct in the response instructs the client what should be played:

- `activity` (string): This is the identifier of the activity to be played
- `dataSetNum` (number): Dataset to be played.  Corresponds to DataSet.DataSetNum in the Imagine database.  This is frequently confused with artificial dataset keys.  So to be clear, this is the very same number that the designer would refer to as "dataset 1000", etc.
- `activitySpecificDatas`: (see below): Returns any activity saved data that's previously been stored for this student / product.
- `diagnosticData`: Anything contained here is meant to be used to facilitate dev and qa but should not be consumed by the client for other purposes, without further discussion.

+ Parameters
    + product = `` (required, string, `ILE`)...The unique identifer (or Name) of the Product to run.
    + clientActivitySupport = `` (optional, number, `123456789`)...The hash/Id of the set of supported Activities and DataSets. Omit the value (or use the value 0) to imply client support of all Activities and DataSets known to the server.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

## Client Activity Support [/activities/support]

        }

## Client Activity Support data [/activities/support/{clientActivitySupport}]

+ Parameters
    + clientActivitySupport (integer hash) ... value used to create client activity support (POST /activities/support)

# Delete Client Activity Suport data [DELETE]

NOTE: Only the root user is authorized to delete client activity support data from server storage. Normally, we would not ever want to delete client activity support data once created. Typically, only a use case for cleaning up test data would call for deleting client activity support data.

+ Response 204

## Student Sequencing Data [/activities/{id}]

Operations on underlying student data store

+ Parameters
    + id (string) ... Student Id.

# Seed the Student with sample Data [POST]

NOTE: Only the root user is authorized to seed a student with sample data. Normally student data would be built over the course of natural use of the product. Typically, only tests would call for seeding a student with data.

The POST content is optional. Either supply valid student data (json document) or omit the content to use a server-side pre-built sample. Student data may only be seeded for a new student, i.e. one that does not yet have sequencing data.
